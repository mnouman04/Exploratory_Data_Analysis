   Capping range: [-3.12, 3.04]

- temperature_2m_std:
   IQR outliers: 303
   Z-score outliers: 0
   Combined outliers: 303
   Capping range: [-2.86, 2.80]

Total Outliers (across all columns): 3614

Technical Rationale:
- Outliers can distort mean/variance, affect model performance, and skew visualizations.
- By capping rather than removing, we retain data size while mitigating extreme skew.

Before-and-After Visualizations:
  Boxplots have been saved in the 'plots' directory for each numeric column.

Decision:
  We applied capping (winsorization) based on IQR boundaries.
